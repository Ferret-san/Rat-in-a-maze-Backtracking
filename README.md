# Rat-in-a-maze-Backtracking
A graphical representation of the Rat in a maze problem that is solved using backtracking. 
The user will be prompted to give a size for the maze which will be used to create a maze of size (userInput^2), if a solution is not foun,
the user can simply press the "r" key to reset the maze, which will prompt the user if they desire to change the size of the maze.
If the user decides to change the size of the maze, take into account that entering a size that will cause the maze to be bigger than the window
will not be displayed properly (size of window is set to 1000x1000px, but can be changed inside of the code).
Finally, if the maze does have a solution, the user can enter the "s" key to see the path displayed in green.
